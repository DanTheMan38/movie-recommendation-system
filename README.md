# Movie Recommendation System

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for personalized movie recommendations using the MovieLens 20M Dataset. This project combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide tailored movie suggestions.

## Motivation

This project is part of my ML Engineering portfolio, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment in a production-ready environment.

## Project Goals

- Build a recommendation system using collaborative and content-based filtering.
- Implement an evaluation pipeline with RMSE as the primary metric.
- Deploy the system as a web application.

## Dataset

The project uses the [MovieLens 20M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/), which contains 20 million ratings for 27,000 movies from 138,000 users.

## Setup

- Clone this repository.
- Create and activate a virtual environment.
- Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
